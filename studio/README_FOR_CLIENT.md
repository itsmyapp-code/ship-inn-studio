Welcome — how to edit Events & News

1) Open the Studio: https://ship-inn-studio.vercel.app/ and log in.
2) Click **News** or **Events** in the left-hand menu.
3) Create or open an item, add Title, Summary, Cover Image and Body.
4) Click **Publish** when ready.

What happens after you Publish
- The Studio will send a webhook to Vercel (make sure the webhook is configured).
- Vercel will start a deploy and the public site will update automatically when the deploy finishes.

If something looks wrong, take a screenshot and contact the site owner or developer.
